            <p><strong>Hi there.</strong></p>
            <p>Welcome to my website. I’m Wes, and I’m thrilled to share a bit about myself with you. I’m a <strong>Junior Software Developer</strong> with a passion for creating clean, efficient code and building software that makes a difference. Whether it's through backend development, front-end design, or digital marketing strategies, I love working on projects that integrate technology with real-world solutions.
Currently, I’m honing my skills at <strong>Tech Solutions</strong>, where I contribute to building and maintaining client-facing applications using Python, JavaScript, and other cutting-edge technologies. My focus is on improving app performance and collaborating with cross-functional teams to implement new features and solve complex problems. It’s been an exciting journey so far, and I’m eager to continue growing as a developer.
Before diving into the world of coding, I gained valuable experience in digital marketing through my internship at <strong>Creative Media</strong>, where I developed content for social media campaigns and analyzed web traffic using Google Analytics. This experience has helped me develop a strong understanding of the intersection between technology, marketing, and business strategy—skills that I carry with me into every project.
As I continue to grow in my career, I’m focused on becoming a well-rounded full-stack developer, working on projects that combine both the technical and creative aspects of development. I’m also excited about the possibility of exploring areas like machine learning, cloud computing, and DevOps in the future.
I’m always open to new opportunities to learn, collaborate, and contribute to impactful projects. If you’re interested in connecting or learning more about my work, feel free to browse through my portfolio, check out my resume, or get in touch with me directly. I’d love to chat about how I can bring value to your team or project.</p>
